## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** with virtual environment support
- **Node.js 18+** with pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- **LiveKit Server** - Download from [LiveKit releases](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases)
- **API Keys**:
  - [Murf Falcon API key](https://murf.ai/api)
  - [Google AI API key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
  - [Deepgram API key](https://deepgram.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayushnema704/Day_5_Zomato_Simple-FAQ-SDR-Lead-Capture-Agent.git
cd Day_5_Zomato_Simple-FAQ-SDR-Lead-Capture-Agent
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Create .env.local with your credentials
# Copy from .env.example and fill in:
```

**backend/.env.local:**
```bash
LIVEKIT_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:7880
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=devkey
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=secret
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
MURF_API_KEY=your_murf_api_key_here
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create .env.local (same LiveKit credentials as backend)
```

**frontend/.env.local:**
```bash
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=devkey
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=secret
LIVEKIT_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:7880
```

### 4. Run the Application

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - LiveKit Server
.\livekit-server.exe --dev

# Terminal 2 - Backend Agent
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe src\agent.py dev

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - LiveKit Server
livekit-server --dev

# Terminal 2 - Backend Agent
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python src/agent.py dev

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

**Access the app:** Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and click **"Talk to Zomato"**

## How It Works

1. **Connect** - Click "Talk to Zomato" to begin conversation
2. **Greeting** - SDR agent welcomes you: "Hello! Thanks for reaching out to Zomato. I'm here to help you explore how we can support your business. What brings you here today?"
3. **Discovery** - Agent asks about your business needs and challenges
4. **FAQ Answering** - When you ask questions about Zomato:
   - Agent calls `search_faq(query)` to find relevant information
   - Provides accurate answers from knowledge base
   - Never makes up information
5. **Lead Qualification** - Throughout conversation, agent organically captures:
   - Name, Email, Company (essential)
   - Role, Use case, Team size, Timeline, Additional notes
6. **Lead Capture** - When sufficient information is gathered, agent saves lead to `leads.json`
7. **Next Steps** - Agent confirms interest and provides appropriate next steps

### Sample Conversation

```
Agent: "Hello! Thanks for reaching out to Zomato. What brings you here today?"
User: "I own a restaurant and want to know about your delivery services."
Agent: "Great! I'd love to help. What's the name of your restaurant?"
User: "It's called Spartan Group of Hotels."
Agent: [Captures company name]
      "And may I have your name and the best email to reach you?"
User: "I'm Michael Scott, email is michael@spartanhotels.com"
Agent: [Calls search_faq("delivery services")]
      "Thanks Michael! For delivery, Zomato provides..."
Agent: [Later, calls capture_lead(...) with all collected information]
      "I've captured all your information. Our team will reach out within 24 hours!"
```

## Project Customizations

Zomato SDR includes several optimizations for sales conversations:

- **Consultative Approach** - Focuses on understanding needs before pitching
- **FAQ Knowledge Base** - Comprehensive Zomato product information
- **Lead Persistence** - All qualified leads saved to JSON with timestamp
- **Zomato Branding** - Red theme matching Zomato's brand identity
- **Natural Conversation** - Captures information organically, not through forms
- **Smart FAQ Search** - Semantic search through services, pricing, and features

## Troubleshooting

**Agent not responding?**
- Ensure all three services are running (LiveKit server, backend agent, frontend)
- Check that API keys are correct in `.env.local` files
- Restart backend agent if it shut down

**"Failed to fetch" error?**
- Restart frontend to reload environment variables: `pnpm dev`
- Verify `.env.local` exists in frontend directory

**Chat not visible?**
- Chat is now visible by default (fixed in `session-view.tsx`)

**Microphone permission denied?**
- Allow microphone access in your browser settings
- Try using HTTPS or localhost (required for microphone access)

**Agent not switching modes?**
- Be explicit: "Switch to quiz mode" or "I want to try teach back mode"
- Agent will confirm the mode switch
